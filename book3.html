                        <b>The Book Thief is a book by Markus Zusak and was first published in the United States in 2006. This book, based on the experiences of Jewish sympathizers in Nazi Germany, was later made into a movie. What is The Book Thief about? The novel begins with Liesel and her mother, Paula, and brother, Werner, traveling by train. Her brother dies on this journey. At the burial, Liesel notices a book left behind by one of the grave diggers, and she steals it. This begins her journey of book stealing. Eventually Liesel makes it to the Hubermanns’ house and begins her life with them. She is tormented by recurring nightmares, and her foster father comforts her. During these long hours together at night, Hans teaches Liesel how to read. This young adult historical fiction book is about kindness, cruelty, death, and the power of words. Markus Zusak was told a story by his mother about the cruelty of the Nazis to the Jews during World War II. This particular story he was told is about a young boy who offered an old, suffering Jewish man who was being marched through town a piece of bread. Enraged by this act of kindness towards the Jewish man, the Nazi soldiers beat both the boy and the old man. Zusak’s mother witnessed this act firsthand. This story is what inspired Zusak to write the novel. </b>
